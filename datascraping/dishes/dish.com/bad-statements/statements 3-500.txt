You can play with your oven temp and try them on 375 to keep them from spreading.  Adding more oil than called for will also cause the cookies to spread -- I wouldn't suggest it, they really don't need extra oil.~Another way to keep them nice and thick and to get the most "crinkled" or "crackled" look is to make them bigger.  When I roll them at about 1.5 inches they look prettier.~And my best tip:  My confectioners' sugar was consistently being absorbed by the dough.  The last time I baked them, I rolled them into balls without rolling in the sugar and let them "dry" for a few minutes.  Then I rolled them in sugar and baked.

One the other hand- if you find that after processing your tomatoes and onions that you have less than 2 cups- simply add enough bottled salsa to make up the difference.~Edited 8-21-06: Do not skip any of the steps.

It is a fattier cut, but the fat melts away in the cooking and is poured away when you discard the liquid.~Note 2: I have an older, smaller crock pot. The above times work perfectly for me. But if you have a newer or bigger crock pot, you may need to revise times downward, esp. after the bbq sauce is added. I think you need at least a couple of hours for it all to meld, but that may be all you need. Update: I recently bought a bigger crockpot, I think 5 or 6 qts. I cooked a 6 lb pork shoulder in it for 8 hours and it was shreddable at that point. Shredded, added the sauce, and cooked for another hour or so to meld everything.

I think this may depend on the size and shape of your roast and the size of your slow cooker.

If you make this ahead of time just refrigerate until needed, shaking it again when you are ready to use it. This also keeps your dirty dishes down.~Mix cornstarch slurry in a large bowl- the mixture will be strange but trust me it works. It will be VERY thick almost paste like. Add ALL the chicken pieces and stir to coat. Using a fork remove ONE chicken piece at a time and let the excess mixture drip off. YES even though the mixture has a weird consistency it will not stick like paste and the excess will drip off. Add chicken to the hot (350 degree) oil and fry until crispy. Only cook 7 or 8 chicken pieces at a time. You do not want to lower the temp of the oil by cooking too many at a time. You can use a simple cooking or candy thermometer to judge the temp of the oil.~Drain on paper towels. Want them extra crispy? Put them on a rack over a sheet pan. Keep warm- I just put them in the oven with the oven off. Repeating until all chicken is fried.~In a separate wok or large skillet add a small amount of oil and heat to 400 degrees. Again, a candy thermometer works great. (Want less dishes?  You can just drain the oil after you fry all the chicken, leave a small amount (about a tsp) in the pan and use the same pan if you like.)~Add green onions and hot peppers and stir fry about 30 seconds.~Stir (or shake jar) sauce mixture, and then add to pan with onions and peppers, cook until thick. Some reviews didn't kniw what "thick" meant. Thick like the same sauce you get at a restaurant.you want it to just coat the chicken. If it gets too thick, add a little water or other liquid. The thickness of the sauce should be similar to what you get when ordering this at a restaurant.~Add chicken to sauce in wok and heat just until the chicken is hot enough for you. It may not even need a minute if you kept the chicken warm. The quicker you serve it the crispier the chicken stays.~Don't be scared by any negative reviews. It's not rocket science though if you have never cooked with a cornstarch slurry it may feel like an experiment. Trust yourself! You've got this! If you have any doubts reread the recipe and get everything in order before you start to cook. I promise you will thank yourself and maybe even me!

On mine it's 450, but use 500 if your oven goes that high.~Do not wash the turkey!  The USDA says that washing it could cause a spread of salmonella poisoning.  Sprinkle salt in the cavities. Stuff if desired.  Don’t pre-stuff your turkey; mix and stuff ingredients immediately before roasting. Tossing in a few pieces of cut fruit or herbs is not considered 'stuffing.'  Stuffing usually means filling up the cavity with about ¾ cup stuffing per pound of turkey.~Rub the entire bird with olive oil or butter. Doctor up your bird with whatever special seasonings you wish.  I always use poultry seasoning. Finish with a good sprinkle of seasoning salt and black pepper.~I highly recommend using a wired thermometer so you can watch the temperature without lifting the lid.  Your turkey will be done much earlier than the estimated cook time, so keep a sharp eye on that thermometer.  If using a pop-up turkey plug type thermometer, those little pop-ups stick sometimes so you should really use two of them.~Put the rack into the insert pan and make sure the handles are up, not tucked below.  Put the bird in the insert pan on top of the rack.  Don’t add water to the pan. Put the insert pan back into the roasting pan.  If your roaster doesn't have an insert pan, it's ok - just be very careful putting the bird into that hot oven, you don't want to burn your hands on the sides of the oven! Cover.~Roast at highest setting for 30 minutes.  The butter/oil, seasonings and the searing time will make the skin beautifully browned and perfect!~After 30 minutes, turn the oven temperature down to 325.~The turkey will self-baste if you do not lift the lid, so you don't have to baste it every 20 minutes like you do in your conventional oven. DO NOT LIFT LID during cooking time!  Lifting the lid will increase cooking time because roaster ovens lose their heat unlike regular ovens.   I've read that roaster ovens effectively 'steam' the turkey making the meat come out  --  well, steamed.  This is not true as you will find out.  Similar to the roasted chickens you can get at your supermarket, the bird will come out moist and perfectly roasted.  Why do you think they call it a Roaster Oven?.~http://www.butterball.com/calculators-and-conversions.~FINAL TEMPERATURE FOR SAFETY AND DONENESS IS: 180 DEGREES IN THIGH AND 165 DEGREES IN BREAST AND STUFFING. Juices should be clear, not pink.~Check your turkey EARLY.  Really start watching the temp an hour before it's supposed to be done. Your turkey will almost certainly be done before the suggested cooking time.  Watch your wired meat thermometer.  If using a pop-up turkey plug type thermometer, check by lifting the lid quickly so the oven doesn’t lose its heat.  If necessary, check after another 30 minutes, but I doubt you'll have to do that.  I say check after 30 minutes because it's really OK to let the bird roast a little extra - you won't dry it out using my method if you let it go for 1/2 hour.~When done, remove the turkey from the roaster, tent with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes.  This allows the juices to really seep into the meat, so they say.~If you try this method, please let us know your results!~Happy Thanksgiving everyone!", 1, 1, "https://www.food.com/recipe/perfect-turkey-in-an-electric-roaster-oven-339453");
