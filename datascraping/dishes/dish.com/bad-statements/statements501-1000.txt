If you are lucky, you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound.~If there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket, you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves.~------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------.~The heavier and more solid it is, the better it is.~Smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter.~You may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch.~Keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher.~--------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------.~Watch out for the red dyed ones.~Pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones.~The smaller the better.~If you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes, they are the best.~-------------Selecting the Carrots----------.~Get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots, because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage.~Serving a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day.~Preparing and cooking the meal-----------------------.~(It's going to take 3 hours with you there).~Use a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once.~Place the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot.~There's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate.~Add the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves.~Cover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer).~Bring to a boil.~Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 2 hours.~During the 2 hours------------------------.~Scrub and rinse the new red potatoes.~Remove any eyes and bad spots.~Leave as much of the peel as you can.~Quarter them (halve or whole if tiny).~Cover with water until ready for them.~Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green, rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together.

Then continue to slowly add flour 1/2 Cup at a time until the dough quits sticking to the sides of the bowl. It should be tacky to the touch. The trick is to have enough consistency to stand up with the least amount of flour so the bread will be fluffy. It will most likely be 6 1/2 cups but in any case do not exceed 7 1/2 cups of wheat flour. You can trade one cup of wheat flour for one cup of all purpose white if you wish. Don't over mix or the bread will be tough.~When your dough is finished, leave it in the mixer, cover the bowl and let it rise for about 30-45 minutes. The dough will be larger but it doesn't need to double.~Grease two bread pans with Crisco. You can also flour the pans to reduce sticking.~Mix the dough again just enough to knock it down at least close to the original size.~Drop the dough on a floured surface so you can work the dough and shape it. Shape it with your hands to make a nice ball getting enough flour on it so it isn't sticky. Divide the ball in half and do it again. Shape the loaves by turning the dough under it's self over and over. When the dough is shaped the sides and ends will be sealed and all you will see is a nice oblong shaped loaf with smooth sides and top. Drop the loaves in your bread pans and let them rise until almost doubled. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 for 36 minutes. If you forgot to preheat 41 minutes. (gas oven).~When done turn the bread out of the pan to a rack to cool. You can eat it right away (a great time for real butter) don't wrap it until completely cooled.

They should combine nicely into a soupy soy liquid.~Put Deer Loin in a cooking tray and pour Brown Sugar/Soy Sauce mixture over loin. Roll tenderloin over in mixture, completely covering it.~Let meat marinate in mixture at least 3 hours or overnight in fridge. It's best to marinate for 8 hours if you have the time. Also GREAT to use a Food Saver or other Vacuum device to Vacuum pack/seal the meat with Marinade. With this method, you can achieve Overnight-level marinade in just a couple hours!~Remove loin from tray, and place on a slotted bake sheet with a drip pan or aluminum foil below to catch dripping. Don't throw away marinade.~Wrap a piece of bacon around the very end of the  tenderloin, securing the bacon strip with a toothpick.~Repeat this process until the entire loin is wrapped in ten or so bacon "loops." The tenderloin should look like an arm with a bunch of wrist watches on it, the watches being the bacon strips.~Drizzle remaining marinade over deer loin. You can continue to baste the loin with the marinade throughout the cooking process with either a brush or a turkey baster.~Place on center rack in oven and bake at 350°F for 30-40* minutes. *This should cook the meat to about Medium. For those of you who prefer rare meat (like me), cut the time to 25-30 minutes and then follow with the "OPTION 2" step below regarding searing.~OPTION 1 - with about 10 minutes of cooking time left, you can lightly dust the top of the loin with white sugar. This creates a sweet crust on top of the bacon. Might be too sweet for some. Try doing it on just HALF of the loin to see if you like it!~OPTION 2 - For a crispier crust and crispier bacon, remove Loin from oven and place the Loin(s) directly on a Grill over medium-high heat to sear the bacon and outer loin. (Thanks to all of you reviewers who taught me this. It's a great step for those of us who like a cooked crust and a pink center).~Remove from oven and place on cutting board. Using a knife, cut the loin between each strip of bacon so that you have many pieces of meat, each with their own toothpick.~You can eat these pieces directly from the toothpick or remove the toothpick and eat like steak.
